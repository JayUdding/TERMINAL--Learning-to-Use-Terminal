Remember, this is not an exhaustive list
Likely encounter many more commands as I become more comfortable with the terminal. 
Practice using these commands to become proficient in using the terminal effectively.

Control - C stops execution of an ongoing action.

Blinking cursor is where the command line starts 
We see user name followed by possibly the directory we are in (ie. Desktop), 
followed by % sign. If we press return/enter then a new command line presents. 
Commands are only executed in the directory we are in at the moment. 
We can't interact with the terminal with the mouse (but we can use it to place the cursor). 
You can only use the arrow keys and keyboard. 
The UP arrow is useful to select previous commands used in the session.



man--if you do not know what a command does or what a specific parameter related to a command does, 
the manual (man) page will provide you with all the information you need. 

itconfig --checks IP address and related

netstat --lists network configurations

ls list

-l get more details

The ~ shows where you are in the file system of the Mac. ~ is a shortcut that means the current user’s Home folder.

The % is a character that the shell (the default interface that Terminal uses) displays to indicate that it’s ready to accept a command.The % sign is just there to show you where your line command starts. If you press return, you’ll see another line with a % sign, indicating that the previous line has been abandoned.

The point is that ls can provide additional information about files and folders, depending on the options you specify. In this case, that additional information includes the name of the user who owns each item in the directory. (That ownership is part of the Unix system’s file-permissions regime.) You can view invisible files—ones that the Finder doesn’t normally show you—by typing ls -a. (These hidden files all have dots (.) in front of their names.)

cd (or change directory) command So let’s say you’re in your Home folder and want to peek inside the Downloads folder. To do that, you’d type cd Downloads.

If you type cd and press the Return key—with no directory specified—you’ll go back to your Home folder. (You can also type cd ~ to go there.)

If you type cd /, you’ll go to the root level of your startup disk

ALSO NOTE VARIOUS PODCASTS

If you type cd .. (that’s two periods), you’ll go to the directory above the one you’re currently in. So if you’re in your home folder, and type cd .., you’ll go to your Mac’s /Users folder. This is like a Back Button

And if you type cd - (hyphen) you’ll go back to the directory you were in before the last time you issued the cd command.

Terminal is the built-in shell environment on Mac that allows you to directly issue UNIX commands. The Mac terminal works via commands. Unlike a traditional app (or GUI app), where you navigate by clicking buttons with the mouse, the terminal is a LUI app. This means you interact with the terminal by typing in keywords and phrases (i.e., commands) that tell the terminal what to do.

Homebrew is what’s known as a package manager. All this means is that you can install packages (i.e., apps) using Homebrew. Think of it as the App Store but for your Mac’s terminal.

**history, clear, ***, and sudo

history -- gives the history of commands made in the session clear -- does clear the window back to a basic command line where we were
history -c clears the history

-- wildcard symbol --returns all with the reference to follow it. eg. *.pdf sudo -- means you are using as an administrator, superuser--and you are overriding protections! say --will make computer talk
Once you get the hang of moving around the Mac terminal, you’re ready to start learning the fundamental commands. In my opinion, that means understanding how history, clear, *, and sudo work.

history shows you a brief history of the commands recently entered into the terminal. 

clear --clears the window back to a basic terminal screen. 

* This isn’t so much a command as it is an important symbol to be familiar with. It’s known as the “wildcard” symbol and is used to reference anything within certain criteria.

sudo is used to run commands as a superuser, or as an admin. It means that you’re overriding some basic protection of your Mac and making an alteration to your computer
