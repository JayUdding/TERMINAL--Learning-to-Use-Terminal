COMMANDS MEMORIZATION / SELF TESTING  I am using macOS so I have Zsh Shell (not Bash Shell)

Terminal opens with username@computername (or hostname)
~ means home directory 
% is the prompt symbol -- means ready for input as a normal non-root user
# is also a prompt symbol and means ready for input as a root user (admin)
Terminal default is in the Home Directory
Home Directory is where the personal files (docs, downloads, apps, etc.) live.


PS1

$ stands for value (echo $PS1 will give value of)
$ tells the shell to expand the variable and provide its value

%n@%m %1~ %# -- %n here stands for username (in Bash, the standard is \u for username)

%n = username 
%m = hostname 
%1~ = current directory (shortened) 
%# = prompt symbol (% for normal user, # for root)

Changes will be lost, but can be exported permanently into a configuration file..
nano ~/.zshrc opens your configuration file in the nano text editor.

Now, you can add your PS1 command to the end of the file.


Example: export PS1="%F{green}%n%f@%F{blue}%m%f %F{red}%1~%f %# "
then Ctrl+O and enter and Ctrl+X to exit Nano
To reload the configuration, you need to run a command that tells Zsh to read the file again.

The command is:


Copy Code
source ~/.zshrc

So:

nano ~/.zshrc → edit the file
source ~/.zshrc → apply changes immediately
Restart terminal → apply changes next time

source -- reads and executes commands from a file in the current shell.

Final Recap:
We’ve learned:

PS1 controls the prompt
It’s a shell variable
You can customize it with colors and formatting
But changes are temporary unless saved
To save changes, edit ~/.zshrc
Use export PS1="..." to make changes persistent
Use source ~/.zshrc to apply changes immediately
Always back up your ~/.zshrc file



date -- shows current date and time
exit -- saves the current version and no longer allows input (then it should be closed)
Note: on a mac this does not automatically close the Terminal, nor does Control + D

pwd -- shows working directory, provides path to the current working directory
Example result: /users/username
mkdir --- make a new directory
mkdir test (make a new directory called test)--then press pwd to see if it is there!

TIP: Tip: If you want to create a directory with a space in its name, 
you'll need to surround the name with quotes. For example, mkdir "My Projects"

ls list of files and folders
ls -a (shows all files including hidden files)
ls -l (shows all files in long format)
ls -l shows details, i.e. date, permission, size
cd go to another directory, moves to a different folder
cd .. go up one directory to the parent directory
cd ~ go to the home directory
cd ./` - Move to the current directory (refresh)
cd - go back to the previous working directory (like a back button)

TIP: The command cd Documents is used to change the current directory to the Documents directory.

When you type cd Documents and press Enter, you'll move from your current directory 
to the Documents directory. The cd command stands for "change directory," 
and it's used to navigate through your file system.

Tip: If the Documents directory is not in your current directory, 
you'll need to specify the full path to the directory. 
For example, if the Documents directory is in your home directory, 
you would use cd ~/Documents.

EXAMPLE: You don’t need to cd into Documents first to copy a file into it. 
You can do it in one step.

cp example.txt ~/Documents (adds the path)

touch -- creates a new empty file

TAB is an autocomplete

rm --remove a file
cp --copy a file / example: cp hello.py backup.py (note no comma between the two filenames)
mv --move a file OR RENAME a file / example: mv backup.py scripts/   //  mv oldname.py newname.py

TIP: Be careful when using mv
as it will overwrite any existing file with the same name in the destination directory.

cat --view a file, display contents of a file
top --shows running processes in real time (a continuously updating view)

TIP: If you want to display the contents of multiple files at once, 
you can separate the filenames with spaces, like this: cat example.txt anotherfile.txt
To scroll through the output if it's too long to fit in the terminal, 
use a pager like less or more. For example: cat example.txt | less

head--display first 10 lines of a file
tail-display last 10 lines of a file
head -n20 textfile.txt (displays the first 20 lines of textfile.txt)
head -20 textfile.txt (same)

grep--search for 
(global regular expression print)
TIP: If you want to search for a word in multiple files, 
use the * wildcard to specify multiple files
Example: grep word *.txt
TIP: To search for a word in a case-insensitive manner, 
use the -i option, like this: grep -i word example.txt



touch--make a new file/ example: touch test (make a new file called test that is an empty file)
cd test (change into the test directory)

!! runs last command
UP ARROW goes also to the last command
history
say
clear
whoami --> use id -p instead

arp -a
traceroute
rmdir test (remove directory called test)
rm -r test (remove directory test when it is not empty)
CONTROL C--cancel command
CONTROL D--Exit Terminal


**File Management**

1. `mkdir` - Make a new directory
2. `rm` - Remove a file or directory
3. `rm -r` - Remove a directory and its contents recursively [includes all subfiles, etc.]
4. `rm -f` - Force remove a file or directory without prompting
5. `cp` - Copy a file or directory
6. `cp -r` - Copy a directory and its contents recursively [see below]

cp -r ---a command that copies a directory named ____ and all its contents to _______.

The filesystem is a tree structure: a folder can contain files, which can contain other folders, and so on. 
Non-recursive: "Clean this room" (only cleans the main room).
Recursive: "Clean this room and every room inside it, and every room inside those rooms, and so on". 

TIP: Example: cp example.txt ~/Documents)
Remember to specify the source and destination for the copy operation.
If you want to rename the file while copying it, 
specify a new name as the destination. 
Example: cp example.txt ~/Documents/newfile.txt 
This now will copy the example.txt file to the ~/Documents directory and rename it to newfile.txt.




7. `mv` - Move or rename a file or directory

Practice using these commands to become proficient in using the terminal effectively.

Control - C stops execution of an ongoing action.

Blinking cursor is where the command line starts 
We see user name followed by possibly the directory we are in (ie. Desktop), 
followed by % sign. 
If we press return/enter then a new command line presents. 
Commands are only executed in the directory we are in at the moment. 
We can't interact with the terminal with the mouse (but we can use it to place the cursor). 
You can only use the arrow keys and keyboard. 
The UP arrow selects the previous commands used in the session.



man--if you do not know what a command does or what a specific parameter related to a command does, 
the manual (man) page will provide you with all the information you need. 

itconfig --checks IP address and related

netstat --lists network configurations

ls list

-l get more details

The ~ shows where you are in the file system of the Mac. ~ is a shortcut that means the current user’s Home folder.

The % is a character that the shell (the default interface that Terminal uses) displays to indicate that it’s ready to accept a command.The % sign is just there to show you where your line command starts. If you press return, you’ll see another line with a % sign, indicating that the previous line has been abandoned.

The point is that ls can provide additional information about files and folders, depending on the options you specify. In this case, that additional information includes the name of the user who owns each item in the directory. (That ownership is part of the Unix system’s file-permissions regime.) You can view invisible files—ones that the Finder doesn’t normally show you—by typing ls -a. (These hidden files all have dots (.) in front of their names.)

cd (or change directory) command So let’s say you’re in your Home folder and want to peek inside the Downloads folder. To do that, you’d type cd Downloads.

If you type cd and press the Return key—with no directory specified—you’ll go back to your Home folder. (You can also type cd ~ to go there.)

If you type cd /, you’ll go to the root level of your startup disk

ALSO NOTE VARIOUS PODCASTS

If you type cd .. (that’s two periods), you’ll go to the directory above the one you’re currently in. So if you’re in your home folder, and type cd .., you’ll go to your Mac’s /Users folder. This is like a Back Button

And if you type cd - (hyphen) you’ll go back to the directory you were in before the last time you issued the cd command.

Terminal is the built-in shell environment on Mac that allows you to directly issue UNIX commands. The Mac terminal works via commands. Unlike a traditional app (or GUI app), where you navigate by clicking buttons with the mouse, the terminal is a LUI app. This means you interact with the terminal by typing in keywords and phrases (i.e., commands) that tell the terminal what to do.

Homebrew is what’s known as a package manager. All this means is that you can install packages (i.e., apps) using Homebrew. Think of it as the App Store but for your Mac’s terminal.

**history, clear, ***, and sudo

history -- gives the history of commands made in the session clear -- does clear the window back to a basic command line where we were
history -c clears the history

-- wildcard symbol --returns all with the reference to follow it. eg. *.pdf sudo -- means you are using as an administrator, superuser--and you are overriding protections! say --will make computer talk
Once you get the hang of moving around the Mac terminal, you’re ready to start learning the fundamental commands. In my opinion, that means understanding how history, clear, *, and sudo work.

history shows you a brief history of the commands recently entered into the terminal. 

clear --clears the window back to a basic terminal screen. 

* This isn’t so much a command as it is an important symbol to be familiar with. It’s known as the “wildcard” symbol and is used to reference anything within certain criteria.

sudo is used to run commands as a superuser, or as an admin. It means that you’re overriding some basic protection of your Mac and making an alteration to your computer

Here's a **clean, one-page printable terminal cheat sheet** — optimized for printing, with all the essential commands in a compact layout. Just copy the text below into a document (like Google Docs or Word), adjust font size if needed, and print!
