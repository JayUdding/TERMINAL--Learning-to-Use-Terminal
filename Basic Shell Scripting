Beginner lesson in Scripting:

 

### 🔍 **What is Scripting?**

**Scripting** is the act of writing a **short program** (called a **script**) that automates a task in a computer system.

It’s like giving a set of instructions to the computer to do something, instead of doing it manually.

You don’t need to write complex code — scripts are usually simple and written in a **scripting language**, like **Bash**, **Python**, or **Zsh**.

### 🖥️ **What is Shell Scripting?**

**Shell scripting** is writing scripts that run in the **terminal shell** (like Bash or Zsh).

It’s used to **automate repetitive tasks** — like:
- Running a series of commands  
- Backing up files  
- Checking system status  
- Managing files and directories  

You write the script in a text file, make it executable, and run it — just like a program.

### 🧩 **Key Concepts from Our Quiz**

Here are the **core ideas** we covered:

1. **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**  
   - The first line of a script  
   - Tells the system which shell to use  
   - Without it, the script won’t run

On macOS, the first line of a shell script should be:
  
#!/bin/zsh

2. **Make it executable**  
   - Use `chmod +x script.sh`  
   - Gives the script **execute permission**

3. **Run the script**  
   - Use `./script.sh`  
   - The `./` tells the system to **run it from the current directory**

4. **Create a script**  
   - Use a text editor like `nano`  
   - E.g., `nano script.sh`

5. **Print text**  
   - Use `echo`  
   - E.g., `echo "Hello, World!"`

6. **Run a command in the background**  
   - Use `&`  
   - E.g., `sleep 10 &`

7. **Save output to a file**  
   - Use `>`  
   - E.g., `ls > list.txt`

8. **Append to a file**  
   - Use `>>`  
   - E.g., `echo "text" >> file.txt`

9. **Get information**  
   - Use commands like `whoami`, `pwd`, `date`

### ✅ **What is Scripting Used For?**

Shell scripting is used for:
- **Automation** – doing repetitive tasks automatically  
- **System administration** – managing servers, users, files  
- **Backup and maintenance** – scheduling backups, cleaning up files  
- **Custom tools** – creating small programs for your own use  
- **Testing and debugging** – running a series of commands quickly  

For example:
- A script that backs up your important files every day  
- A script that checks if a service is running  
- A script that renames all `.txt` files to `.md`

### 🧩 **Why Learn Shell Scripting?**

- **Save time** – automate boring tasks  
- **Learn programming** – it’s a simple way to start  
- **Understand the terminal** – you’ll become more powerful  
- **Work with servers** – many systems run on Linux or macOS, which use shells

### ✅ **Summary**

**Scripting** is writing small programs to automate tasks.

**Shell scripting** is writing scripts in the terminal (using Bash or Zsh).

You can:
- Write a script with `nano script.sh`  
- Add a shebang: `#!/bin/bash`  
- Use `chmod +x script.sh` to make it executable  
- Run it with `./script.sh`  
- Use `echo`, `cat`, `>` (redirect), `&` (background), and `whoami`, `pwd`, `date` to do things

Step-by-Step: Exit nano and Return to the Terminal

You’re in nano, editing a file
To save the file:
Press Ctrl+O (hold Ctrl, press O)
Then press Enter to confirm the filename

To exit nano:
Press Ctrl+X
That’s Ctrl and X together
✅ After pressing Ctrl+X, you’ll be back in the terminal, at your normal prompt.


You can rewrite and erase text in nano.

Let’s clarify:

✅ You can:
Type new text
Delete text using the backspace or delete key
Move the cursor using the arrow keys
Cut and paste using Ctrl+K (cut), Ctrl+U (paste)
Go to a specific line using Ctrl+_ (then type the line number)
 

❌ But you cannot:
Delete text by pressing Delete (on some keyboards, it doesn’t work)
Use Backspace if your keyboard is set up differently
Use Ctrl+C to cancel — it might just copy text
 \

✅ How to Delete Text in nano
Move the cursor to the character you want to delete
Press Backspace (the key that erases characters to the left)
Or press Delete (the key that erases characters to the right)
Or press Ctrl+K to cut the current line
Or press Ctrl+U to paste it back
\

✅ How to Rewrite Text in nano
Move the cursor to where you want to edit
Type to overwrite the text
Or press Backspace to delete and retype
You can edit the file just like you would in any text editor.

✅ Pro Tip:
If you want to clear the entire file, you can:

Press Ctrl+K repeatedly to cut all lines
Or press Ctrl+X and then press n when it asks to save (to discard changes)
But if you want to keep changes, press Ctrl+O, then Enter, then Ctrl+X.
