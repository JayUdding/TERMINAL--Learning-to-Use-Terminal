TERMINAL--Learning-to-Use-Terminal

The Top file (Commands) is a list of the various commands for Terminal and some example uses.
I use AI (the Copilot and Maple.AI) to create daily quizzes to memorize and practice the prompts and refine the explanations.
Goal: Stop with the quizzes and continue other learning when all tests are passed with ease and the use of Terminal feels like second nature.

To create as part of learning:

Flashcards
Cheatsheet

**Interactive shell script**: Write a simple shell script that presents you with a series of Terminal commands and asks you to type them in. You can use a tool like `read` or `dialog` to create an interactive prompt.
**Command reference file**: Create a Markdown or text file with a list of commands, their explanations, and examples. You can use headers, sections, and formatting to make it easy to read and navigate.
**Terminal-based game**: Create a simple game that tests your knowledge of Terminal commands. For example, you can write a script that generates a random command and asks you to type it in correctly.

Some popular tools and platforms for creating these types of projects include:

* **Anki**: A popular flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you memorize information.
* **Quizlet**: A study app that offers flashcards, tests, and study games for a wide range of subjects, including Terminal commands.
* **GitHub Gist**: A platform for sharing and collaborating on code snippets, including shell scripts and Terminal commands.
* **Markdown editors**: Tools like Mou, Typora, or Bear that allow you to create and edit Markdown documents.
* **Shell scripting tools**: Tools like Bash, Zsh, or Fish that allow you to write and run shell scripts.

Remember, the most important thing is to choose a format and tool that works for you and your learning style. Good luck with your project, and have fun learning Terminal commands!
